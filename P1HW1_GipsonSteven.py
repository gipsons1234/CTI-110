# Prompt the user to enter the first integer
num1 = int(input("Enter the integer: "))

# Print the integer, its square, and its cube
print(f"You entered{num1}")
print(f"The square of the integer is {num1 ** 2}")
print(f"The cube of the integer is {num1 ** 3}")

# Prompt the user to enter the second integer
num2 = int(input("Enter another integer: "))

# Print the sum and product of the two integers
print(f"{num1} + {num2} = {num1 + num2}")
print(f"{num1} * {num2} = {num1 * num2}")
